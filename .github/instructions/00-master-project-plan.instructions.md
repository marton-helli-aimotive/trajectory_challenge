# Trajectory Prediction System - Master Project Plan

## Project Overview
This document provides the complete development roadmap for the Advanced Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Engineering Challenge, broken down into 10 structured milestones with clear dependencies and risk management.

## Development Strategy

### Risk Mitigation Approach
1. **Foundation First**: Establish solid infrastructure before complex implementations
2. **Incremental Validation**: Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
3. **Early Feedback**: Implement basic versions early to validate approaches
4. **Modular Design**: Ensure components can be developed and tested independently

### Critical Path Analysis
The project follows a sequential dependency chain with some opportunities for parallel development:

```
Milestone 1 → Milestone 2 → Milestone 3 → Milestone 4 → Milestone 5 → Milestone 6 → Milestone 7 → Milestone 8 → Milestone 9 → Milestone 10
```

## Milestone Dependencies & Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- **Milestone 1**: Project Foundation & Environment Setup (Week 1)
- **Milestone 2**: Data Models & Validation Framework (Week 2-3)
- **Milestone 3**: NGSIM Data Integration & ETL Pipeline (Week 3-4)

### Phase 2: Core Development (Weeks 5-8)
- **Milestone 4**: Feature Engineering Framework (Week 5-6)
- **Milestone 5**: Baseline & Classical Models (Week 6-7)
- **Milestone 6**: Advanced ML Models & Uncertainty Quantification (Week 7-8)

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Visualization (Weeks 9-10)
- **Milestone 7**: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework (Week 9)
- **Milestone 8**: Interactive Dashboard & Visualization (Week 10)

### Phase 4: Production & Finalization (Weeks 11-12)
- **Milestone 9**: MLOps & Production Pipeline (Week 11)
- **Milestone 10**: Testing, Documentation & Final Integration (Week 12)

## Parallel Development Opportunities

### After Milestone 4 (Feature Engineering):
- **Parallel Track A**: Baseline models (Milestone 5)
- **Parallel Track B**: Basic evaluation metrics for early validation

### After Milestone 6 (Advanced Models):
- **Parallel Track A**: Evaluation framework (Milestone 7)
- **Parallel Track B**: Basic dashboard prototype

## Risk Assessment by Milestone

### High Risk Milestones
- **Milestone 6**: Advanced ML Models (GP scalability, MDN complexity)
- **Milestone 9**: MLOps & Production (Integration complexity)

### Medium Risk Milestones
- **Milestone 3**: ETL Pipeline (NGSIM data quality, async complexity)
- **Milestone 4**: Feature Engineering (Performance with large datasets)
- **Milestone 8**: Dashboard (Performance, user experience)

### Low Risk Milestones
- **Milestone 1, 2, 5, 7, 10**: Well-established patterns and technologies

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
1. **Type Safety**: Maintain mypy compliance throughout
2. **Test Coverage**: Achieve >90% coverage incrementally
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize at each milestone
4. **Documentation**: Update continuously, not at the end

### Validation Gates
Each milestone must meet its success criteria before proceeding:
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met
- Code review completed

## Potential Ambiguities & Clarifications Needed

### Data Requirements
- **NGSIM Dataset Version**: Which specific NGSIM dataset files to use?
- **Data Volume**: Expected scale for performance optimization?
- **Real-time Requirements**: Latency expectations for production serving?

### Model Requirements
- **Prediction Horizon**: What time horizon for trajectory predictions?
- **Update Frequency**: How often should models be retrained?
- **Accuracy Thresholds**: What constitutes acceptable performance?

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Deployment Environment**: Cloud vs. on-premise requirements?
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU/memory/GPU availability?
- **Scalability Targets**: Expected user load and data volume?

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Quality**: >90% test coverage, mypy compliance
- **Performance**: <100ms prediction latency, <1GB memory usage
- **Model Performance**: Competitive with literature benchmarks
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, graceful error handling

### Deliverable Completeness
- All 7 required deliverables completed
- Complete documentation package
- Production-ready containerized system
- Comprehensive evaluation and benchmark report

## Recommended Development Order

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data (Milestones 1-3)
Focus on solid infrastructure and data pipeline. This is critical for everything else.

### Phase 2: Models & Features (Milestones 4-6)  
Build the core ML pipeline. Start simple and add complexity progressively.

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Visualization (Milestones 7-8)
Comprehensive analysis and user interface. Can start basic versions earlier.

### Phase 4: Production & Polish (Milestones 9-10)
MLOps integration and final testing. Focus on robustness and documentation.

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this milestone plan
2. Clarify any ambiguous requirements
3. Begin Milestone 1: Project Foundation & Environment Setup
4. Set up regular progress reviews at milestone boundaries
