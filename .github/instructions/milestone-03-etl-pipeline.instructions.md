# Milestone 3: NGSIM Data Integration & ETL Pipeline

## Objective
Build a scalable ETL pipeline for NGSIM trajectory data with async processing, implement columnar storage with Parquet, and create a data source factory pattern for extensibility.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Async ETL pipeline using asyncio and aiohttp
- [ ] NGSIM dataset integration with proper schema mapping
- [ ] Parquet storage with optimal partitioning strategy
- [ ] Data source factory pattern for multiple dataset support
- [ ] Incremental data loading capabilities
- [ ] Data quality pipeline with cleaning and validation

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Async ETL Pipeline
```python
# Core ETL components
- DataExtractor: async data fetching with aiohttp
- DataTransformer: trajectory processing and validation
- DataLoader: efficient Parquet writing with partitioning
- Pipeline orchestrator: managing async workflows
```

### 2. NGSIM Integration
- Download and process NGSIM trajectory files
- Map NGSIM schema to standardized trajectory format
- Handle NGSIM-specific data quality issues
- Extract vehicle behavior patterns (lane changes, following)

### 3. Storage Strategy
- Parquet partitioning by date/location/vehicle_type
- Columnar optimization for trajectory queries
- Compression and encoding optimization
- Index creation for fast filtering

### 4. Data Source Factory
- Abstract DataSource interface
- NGSIMDataSource implementation
- Support for future datasets (extensible design)
- Configuration-driven data source selection

### 5. Data Quality Pipeline
- Missing data detection and interpolation
- Outlier detection and filtering
- Trajectory segmentation and cleaning
- Validation against physics constraints

## Dependencies
- Milestone 2: Data Models & Validation Framework

## Risk Factors
- **Medium Risk**: NGSIM data format complexity and quality issues
- **Medium Risk**: Async pipeline complexity may introduce bugs
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with synthetic data first
- **Mitigation**: Progressive complexity increase in async processing

## Deliverables
1. Complete async ETL pipeline
2. NGSIM data integration with schema mapping
3. Optimized Parquet storage system
4. Data source factory with extensible design
5. Data quality pipeline with comprehensive cleaning
6. Performance benchmarks for data processing

## Next Milestone
Milestone 4: Feature Engineering Framework (depends on this milestone)
