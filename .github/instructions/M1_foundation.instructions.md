# Milestone 1: Project Foundation & Architecture Setup

## Overview
Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and core architectural patterns that will support the entire trajectory prediction pipeline.

## Duration: 3-4 days

## Objectives
- Set up clean, scalable project structure following Python best practices
- Configure comprehensive development environment with all necessary tools
- Implement core architectural patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer)
- Establish type safety and code quality standards

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Project Structure ✅
```

├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── docker/                 # Container configurations
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

### 2. Development Environment ✅
- **Python 3.11+** with pyproject.toml configuration
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **pre-commit** hooks configured with:
  - black (code formatting)
  - isort (import sorting)
  - mypy (type checking)
  - flake8 (linting)
  - pytest (testing)
- **VS Code** configuration with Python extensions
- **.gitignore** properly configured for ML projects

### 3. Core Architecture Patterns ✅
- **Abstract base classes** for models, data sources, and evaluators
- **Factory pattern** for model creation and dataset loading
- **Strategy pattern** for different prediction algorithms
- **Observer pattern** for training progress monitoring
- **Type hints** throughout with Protocol definitions

### 4. Configuration Management ✅
- **Hydra** setup with hierarchical configs
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)
- Model hyperparameter configurations
- Data source configurations

### 5. Documentation & Standards ✅
- **README.md** with setup instructions
- **Architecture documentation** explaining design decisions
- **Contributing guidelines** with coding standards
- **Type checking** enabled and passing

## Technical Deliverables

1. **pyproject.toml** with all dependencies
2. **Core interfaces** (AbstractModel, AbstractDataSource, AbstractEvaluator)
3. **Factory classes** for extensible component creation
4. **Configuration schemas** using Pydantic
5. **Development scripts** for common tasks
6. **CI/CD foundation** with GitHub Actions

## Dependencies
- None (foundation milestone)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Over-engineering the architecture
- **Mitigation**: Keep abstractions simple, add complexity only when needed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project structure follows Python packaging best practices
- [ ] All development tools configured and working
- [ ] Type checking passes with mypy
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass on sample code
- [ ] Basic tests run successfully
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive

## Notes
- Focus on simplicity and extensibility
- Ensure all patterns support testing and mocking
- Keep configuration flexible for different deployment scenarios
