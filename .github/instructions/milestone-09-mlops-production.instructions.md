# Milestone 9: MLOps & Production Pipeline

## Objective
Implement a complete MLOps pipeline with experiment tracking, model registry, monitoring, and production deployment capabilities for the trajectory prediction system.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MLflow experiment tracking and model registry
- [ ] Production model serving with FastAPI
- [ ] Data drift detection and model monitoring
- [ ] A/B testing framework for model deployment
- [ ] Complete containerization and orchestration setup

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Experiment Tracking & Model Registry
```python
# MLflow Integration
- Experiment tracking: hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts
- Model registry: versioning, staging, production promotion
- Model lineage: data and feature tracking
- Artifact storage: models, plots, evaluation reports
```

### 2. Model Serving Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Service**: REST API for trajectory prediction
- **Batch Prediction**: Large-scale trajectory processing
- **Model Loading**: Dynamic model selection and switching
- **Input Validation**: Request validation and preprocessing
- **Response Formatting**: Standardized prediction outputs

### 3. Monitoring & Observability
- **Data Drift Detection**: Using Evidently AI for distribution changes
- **Model Performance**: Real-time accuracy and latency monitoring
- **System Health**: Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- **Prediction Quality**: Continuous evaluation against ground truth

### 4. A/B Testing Framework
- **Traffic Splitting**: Controlled exposure to different models
- **Metric Collection**: Performance comparison across model variants
- **Statistical Testing**: Automated significance testing
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Safe model deployment and reversion

### 5. Containerization & Orchestration
- **Multi-stage Containerfile**: Optimized for ML workloads
- **Podman-compose Setup**: Services for database, serving, dashboard
- **GPU Support**: Configuration for deep learning models
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory optimization for different services

### 6. Data Pipeline Orchestration
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration for ETL and training
- **Task Dependencies**: Proper sequencing of data and model pipelines
- **Error Handling**: Robust failure recovery and notification
- **Scheduling**: Automated retraining and evaluation workflows

### 7. Scalability & Distribution
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancing for model serving
- **Distributed Computing**: Dask integration for large-scale processing
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis for frequent predictions
- **Database Integration**: Efficient data storage and retrieval

### 8. Security & Compliance
- **Authentication**: API key management and user authentication
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymization and secure data handling
- **Audit Logging**: Complete request and response tracking
- **Compliance**: GDPR/data protection consideration

### 9. Documentation & Operations
- **Model Cards**: Comprehensive model documentation
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step production setup
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures and troubleshooting
- **Performance Cards**: Bias analysis and fairness evaluation

## Dependencies
- Milestone 8: Interactive Dashboard & Visualization

## Risk Factors
- **High Risk**: Complex MLOps setup may have integration issues
- **Medium Risk**: Performance bottlenecks in production serving
- **Medium Risk**: Data drift detection accuracy and false alarms
- **Mitigation**: Incremental deployment with thorough testing
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization before production
- **Mitigation**: Careful tuning of drift detection thresholds

## Deliverables
1. Complete MLflow experiment tracking and model registry
2. Production-ready FastAPI model serving
3. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
4. A/B testing framework with statistical validation
5. Containerized deployment with orchestration
6. Complete documentation and operational runbooks
