# Trajectory Prediction Project - Development Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the Advanced Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Engineering Challenge, broken down into 8 strategic milestones with clear dependencies and success criteria.

## Development Strategy
- **Risk Reduction**: Core infrastructure first, complex models later
- **Early Validation**: Working baseline models quickly to validate pipeline
- **Parallel Development**: Independent components developed concurrently where possible
- **Incremental Testing**: Each milestone fully tested before proceeding

## Milestone Dependencies
```
M1 (Foundation) → M2 (Data Pipeline) → M3 (Feature Engineering)
                                    ↓
M4 (Model Interface) → M5 (Baseline Models) → M6 (Advanced Models)
                                    ↓
M7 (Evaluation & Visualization) → M8 (Production & Deployment)
```

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Gaussian Process and Mixture Density Network implementation
- **Medium Risk**: Async ETL pipeline scalability, dashboard responsiveness
- **Low Risk**: Baseline models, basic feature engineering, testing framework

## Timeline Estimate
- **Total Duration**: 6-8 weeks for full implementation
- **MVP Ready**: After Milestone 5 (3-4 weeks)
- **Production Ready**: After Milestone 8 (6-8 weeks)

## Quality Gates
Each milestone requires:
1. ✅ All acceptance criteria met
2. ✅ Tests passing with >90% coverage
3. ✅ Type hints and mypy compliance
4. ✅ Documentation updated
5. ✅ Code review completed
