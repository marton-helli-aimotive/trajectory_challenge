# Milestone 2: Data Models & Validation Framework

## Objective
Implement robust data models for trajectory data using Pydantic, establish validation frameworks, and create the foundation for data quality assurance.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Pydantic models for trajectory data with spatial-temporal constraints
- [ ] Data validation pipeline with comprehensive checks
- [ ] Schema support for NGSIM dataset and generic trajectory formats
- [ ] Unit tests for all data models with >95% coverage
- [ ] Property-based testing for physics constraints

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Core Data Models
```python
# Trajectory data structures
- TrajectoryPoint: individual position/velocity/acceleration point
- Trajectory: sequence of points with metadata
- Vehicle: vehicle characteristics and behavior parameters
- Dataset: collection of trajectories with metadata
```

### 2. Validation Rules
- **Spatial Constraints**: Valid coordinate ranges, realistic positions
- **Temporal Constraints**: Monotonic timestamps, reasonable time gaps
- **Physics Constraints**: Maximum velocity/acceleration limits
- **Completeness**: Required fields, minimum trajectory length
- **Consistency**: Speed calculations match reported velocities

### 3. Data Quality Metrics
- Trajectory completeness score
- Temporal consistency indicators
- Spatial accuracy measures
- Smoothness metrics (jerk analysis)

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each Pydantic model
- Property-based testing using Hypothesis for physics constraints
- Edge case testing (empty trajectories, single points, etc.)
- Performance testing for large trajectory collections

## Dependencies
- Milestone 1: Project Foundation & Environment Setup

## Risk Factors
- **Medium Risk**: Complex validation rules may impact performance
- Potential over-engineering of validation logic
- **Mitigation**: Start with essential validations, optimize later

## Deliverables
1. Complete Pydantic model hierarchy
2. Validation pipeline with comprehensive checks
3. Data quality metrics implementation
4. Comprehensive test suite with property-based testing
5. Documentation for data models and validation rules

## Next Milestone
Milestone 3: NGSIM Data Integration (depends on this milestone)
