## Technical Requirements

### 1. Core Feature Categories
```python
# Kinematic Features
- Position derivatives: velocity, acceleration, jerk
- Motion profiles: speed distributions, acceleration patterns
- Trajectory curvature and path characteristics

# Contextual Features
- Lane change detection and classification
- Following behavior indicators
- Traffic density and congestion measures
- Relative motion features (to nearby vehicles)

# Temporal Features
- Time-based patterns and seasonality
- Trajectory duration and sampling characteristics
- Temporal consistency measures
```

### 2. Advanced Feature Engineering
