The gui should contains the following features:
- Data explorer: View the raw dataset in a table. Filtering by multiple columns, sorting, and pagination. DO NOT add additional plotting here.
- Trajectory list: List all detected trajectories in a table. Visualize the selected trajectories by their location, relative the lane markings.
- Road visualization: Display a map view of the road network with the ability to overlay trajectory data. It is animated by the timestamp.

Keep it simple and intuitive. Avoid additional and not requested features. Don't include any complex interactions or unnecessary UI elements. don't respect backward compatibility.
